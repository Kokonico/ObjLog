# ObjLog
> logging, Objectified

## Notice

this repo is a living repository, and the master branch is not guaranteed to be stable. If you want to use this library in a project, please use a release version, or a tagged commit.
it is always in the works, and new features are being added all the time!

## what is this?
This is a logging library for python. It is designed to be simple to use, and easy to understand.

## how do I use it?
You can use it like this:

```python
from objlog import LogNode
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="Basic Example", print_to_console=True)

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message"))
```

output:
```shell
[Basic Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] DEBUG: This is a debug message
[Basic Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] INFO: This is an info message
[Basic Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155799] WARN: This is a warning message
[Basic Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155805] ERROR: This is an error message
[Basic Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155810] FATAL: This is a fatal message
```

(it's even colored in the console!)

## This is cool, but I want to do more!

### I want to log to a file!

```python
from objlog import LogNode
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="File Example", print_to_console=True, log_file="example.log")

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message"))
```

output:
```shell
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] DEBUG: This is a debug message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] INFO: This is an info message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155799] WARN: This is a warning message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155805] ERROR: This is an error message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155810] FATAL: This is a fatal message
```

example.log:
```shell
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] DEBUG: This is a debug message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] INFO: This is an info message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155799] WARN: This is a warning message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155805] ERROR: This is an error message
[File Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155810] FATAL: This is a fatal message
```

### I want a custom log message type!

```python
from objlog import LogNode, LogMessage
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

class CustomMessage(LogMessage):
    color = "\033[32" # green
    level = "CUSTOM"

log = LogNode(name="Custom Example", print_to_console=True)

log.log(CustomMessage("this is a custom message"))
```

output:
```shell
[Custom Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] CUSTOM: This is a custom message
```

(colored green in the console!)


### I want to log messages, but not print them to the console or a log file, than when I'm done, I want to print them all at once!

```python
from objlog import LogNode, LogMessage
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="Buffered Example")

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message"))

log.dump_messages("example.log")  # this will not print the messages to the console, but save them to a file
# or
log.dump_messages_to_console()  # this will print the messages to the console, but not save them to a file

# you can do both if you want!

# if you would like to continue logging after dumping the messages, you can do that too!
```

output:
```shell
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] DEBUG: This is a debug message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] INFO: This is an info message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155799] WARN: This is a warning message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155805] ERROR: This is an error message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155810] FATAL: This is a fatal message
```

example.log:
```shell
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] DEBUG: This is a debug message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] INFO: This is an info message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155799] WARN: This is a warning message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155805] ERROR: This is an error message
[Buffered Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155810] FATAL: This is a fatal message
```

### Amazing! How do I filter messages?

```python
from objlog import LogNode, LogMessage
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="Filter Example")

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message"))

log.dump_messages("example.log", elementfilter=[Warn, Error, Fatal])  # this will not print the messages to the console, but save them to a file if they are a warning, error, or fatal
# the rest of the messages will not be saved to the file

# you can do the same thing with dump_messages_to_console()

log.dump_messages_to_console(elementfilter=[Warn, Error, Fatal])

# you can also filter the log in-place

log.filter(typefilter=[Warn, Error, Fatal])  # this will remove all messages that are not a warning, error, or fatal from the log's memory

# you can also use the filter method to filter the logfile

log.filter(typefilter=[Warn, Error, Fatal], filter_logfiles=True)  # this will remove all messages that are not a warning, error, or fatal from the log's memory, and overwrite the logfile with the filtered messages

# it even works with custom message types!

class CustomMessage(LogMessage):
    color = "\033[32" # green
    level = "CUSTOM"

log.log(CustomMessage("this is a custom message"))
log.log(CustomMessage("this is another custom message"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message"))

log.dump_messages_to_console(elementfilter=[CustomMessage])  # this will only print the custom messages to the console

# output:
# [Filter Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] CUSTOM: This is a custom message
# [Filter Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] CUSTOM: This is another custom message
```

### I want to not have a log file, and then I want to switch to having a log file (and store my old messages in it)!

```python
from objlog import LogNode, LogMessage
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="Switch Example")  # no log file

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message"))

log.set_output_file("example.log")  # now there is a log file, all new messages will be saved to it

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message 2")) # this message will be saved to the log file
log.log(Info("this is an info message 2"))  # this message will be saved to the log file
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message 2"))  # this message will be saved to the log file
log.log(Error("this is an error message 2"))  # this message will be saved to the log file
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message 2"))  # this message will be saved to the log file

# the messages before the log file was set will not be saved to the log file

# to move the old messages to the log file, you can do this:

log.set_output_file("example2.log", preserve_old_messages=True)  # now the old messages will be saved to the log file, and all new messages will be saved to it as well

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message 3")) # this message will be saved to the log file
```

example.log:
```shell
[Switch Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] DEBUG: This is a debug message 2
[Switch Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] INFO: This is an info message 2

[Switch Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155810] FATAL: This is a fatal message 2
```

```

### I have a very limited amount of RAM, and I want to limit the amount of messages that are stored in memory!

```python
from objlog import LogNode
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="Limited Example", max_messages_in_memory=5, log_file="limited.log")  # only store 5 messages in memory

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message 1"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message 1"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message 1"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message 1"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message 1"))

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message 2"))  # this message will be stored in memory, and the oldest message will be removed from memory
```

limited.log:
```shell
[Limited Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155790] INFO: This is an info message 1
[Limited Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155799] WARN: This is a warning message 1
[Limited Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155805] ERROR: This is an error message 1
[Limited Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155810] FATAL: This is a fatal message 1
[Limited Example] [2023-12-08 08:36:33.155766] DEBUG: This is a debug message 2
```

### I have a limited amount of SSD space, and I want to limit the amount of messages that are stored in the log file!

```python
from objlog import LogNode
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="Limited Example", max_log_messages=5, log_file="limited.log")  # only store 5 messages in the log file, but unlimited messages in memory

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message 1"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message 1"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message 1"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message 1"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message 1"))

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message 2"))  # this message will be stored in the log, and the oldest message will be removed from the log

log.dump_messages_to_console()  # this will print all messages in memory to the console (including ones not saved to the log), but not save them to the log file

# to limit both the amount of messages in memory and the amount of messages in the log file, you can do this:

log = LogNode(name="Limited Example", max_messages_in_memory=5, max_log_messages=5, log_file="limited.log")  # only store 5 messages in the log file, and only store 5 messages in memory
```

### I want to log messages, but I don't want to print them to the console or a log file, and I don't want to store them in memory!

1, that's useless why? and 2, you can do that!

```python
from objlog import LogNode
from objlog.LogMessages import Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal

log = LogNode(name="Buffered Example", max_messages_in_memory=0)

log.log(Debug("this is a debug message"))
log.log(Info("this is an info message"))
log.log(Warn("this is a warning message"))
log.log(Error("this is an error message"))
log.log(Fatal("this is a fatal message"))
```

output:
```shell
```
