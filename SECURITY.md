# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it by either
1. Opening a security report on GitHub
2. Submitting a pull request with a fix describing the vulnerability

Please do not disclose security-related issues publicly until they have been addressed by the project maintainers.

## before you report

please make sure that the version of the project that you are reporting the issue on is supported, as we will only fix it there.
Issues that can take place due to poor setup of the project will not be fixed, as they are not the responsibility of the project maintainers.
(unless the setup is the default setup or a "secure" setup, in which case it will be fixed)

## supported versions
